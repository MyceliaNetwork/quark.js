# quark.js

Quark integration script.

Integrate this script in your IC application to support payments on Dfinity's
Internet Computer.

## Websites

- [Quark](https://pwwjo-6qaaa-aaaam-aadka-cai.ic0.app/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@departurelabs/quark.js)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/DepartureLabsIC/quark.js)

## Installation

```sh
npm i -S @departurelabs/quark.js
```

## Usage

Example integration:

```js
import initializeQuark from "@departurelabs/quark.js"

const { checkout } = initializeQuark({
  authProvider: "ii",
  domain: "https://pwwjo-6qaaa-aaaam-aadka-cai.ic0.app",
  notify: {
    principalId: "dlftw-sqaaa-aaaaa-danil-cai",
    methodName: "callback",
  },
  integrator: "rno2w-sqaaa-aaaaa-aaacq-cai",
  callback: event => {
    if (event.type === "checkoutComplete") {
      if (event.data.result === "Accepted") {
        checkoutComplete()
      } else {
        checkoutFailed()
      }
    }
  },
})

const basket = [
  {
    name: "Spoon",
    description: "Use this for your soup",
    value: 10000000,
    token: "ICP",
  },
]

checkout(basket)
```

### Configuration properties

`authProvider` - The provider used to authenticate the user. This value is used
to redirect the user quickly to the correct authentication page when they are
checking out but not yet authenticated.

`domain` - The domain quark.js will send a user to upon checkout. In the future,
we expect larger services might want to self-host their own checkout pages.

`notify` - An object containing the Principal ID as a string and the name of the
canister method as a string. We call this public method when a user completes a
transaction. The Canister will be required to accept or deny each incoming
transaction.

`integrator` - The Principal ID of who Quark should actually send the payment
to. It is generally recommended to keep this the same as your above notify
canister.

**Warning!** This principal must be able to invoke calls against Quark in order
to withdraw funds. Please use only use a canister, a dfx principal identity, or
a Quark user principal unless you are absolutely sure about what you are doing.

`callback` - A javascript method implemented by the integrator to be invoked by
quark.js upon checkout. Will be of shape:

```json
{ "type": "checkoutComplete", "data": { "result": "Accepted" } }
```

```json
{ "type": "checkoutComplete", "data": { "result": "Rejected" } }
```

"Trust, but verify!" is your best course of action when handling the callback
data.

Once you have instantiated the checkout Function we can begin creating a basket
with a couple of transaction items.

## Basket structure

- `basket` The basket is a list of transaction items, defined by the merchant,
  that contains the data necessary for the checkout:
  - `name` - the name of the checked out product. e.g. “Spoon”
  - `value` - the value of the checkout out product. Specified as fractional
    units of an ICP token—called e8s—as a whole number, where one e8 is the
    smallest unit of an ICP token. For example, 1.05000000 is 1 ICP and 5000000
    e8s.
  - `token` - the token used for the transaction of this basket item. Note: at
    this moment we only support ICP
  - `description` - optional description of the checked out product. e.g. “Used
    to eat soup”

## Cross-tab communication

When called, the configuration passed as a parameter is first validated. When
validated, we will attach an eventListener to the window scope. The
eventListener will execute a handler upon receiving an incoming message. When
this message comes from the Quark website it will execute code to ensure
communication between quark.js and the Quark website.

There are two types of incoming messages on the quark.js-side:

- `checkoutLoaded`: this message will be dispatched once the Quark checkout page
  was opened in another tab. Upon receiving this message we will send all the
  necessary data to the opened tab, such as `basket`, `integrator`, etc. using a
  [window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage)
  [MessageEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent)
  with the type "basketUpdate".
- `checkoutComplete`: this is sent to our listener when the user has confirmed
  the checkout on the Quark website. Upon receiving a message with this type, we
  will call the `callback` Function that the user passed inside the init()
  config and it's up to the integrator to take it from there.

Also, there is one type of outgoing message going from the quark.js-side to the
Quark-side:

- `basketUpdate`: When opened in the end-user's browser, the Checkout page on
  the Quark website will listen for this particular message to update the
  contents of the checkout and calculate the total sum of the transaction to
  display this to the user to confirm.

**PLEASE NOTE**: BigInts cannot be serialized client-side and thus we do not
support them in the checkout. You will need to cast them to Numbers instead.

## Token support

We currently only support ICP. More tokens (such as cycles) will follow soon!

Our target token ICP requires its values be set in e8s. One e8 is the smallest
partition of an ICP token (1/10^8 or 10^-8). For example, 123.15000001 ICP is
12_315_000_001 e8s. To convert whole value ICP to e8s simply multiply the ICP
value by 1e8

```js
const icp = 123.3341 // make sure there are more than 8 digits of precision!!
const e8s = icp * 1e8
```

Quick tip: As you are handling other people's capital and its common to run into
floating point errors when performing basic arithmetic. To avoid this, we
recommend using libraries such as:

- [currency.js](https://currency.js.org/)
- [dinero.js](https://dinerojs.com/)
- [numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/)
